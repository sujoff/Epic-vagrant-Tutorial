In this Repo,
I'll document my journey of using Vagrant and useful vagrantfile documentation.

Step 1: Installed Vagrant\
step 2: Installed Oracle VM virtualbox\
step 3: Install git bash (I prefer it for some reason), run `mkdir ubuntu`, `cd ubuntu` and enter\
step 4: I'm goint to spin up three vm named `first`, `second` and `third`

vagrant uses boxes (think of them as base os image) to up the VM.\
Being a Gen-z engineer, I generated a vagrantfile with above description and saved it to Vagrantfile ( yes it don't have any extension).

Step 4: Now run `vagrant up`

Now it should start creating your three ubuntu vm machines like:
